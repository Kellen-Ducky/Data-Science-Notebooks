# Data-Science-Notebooks

I created this repo to showcase any data science notebook project I've worked on. 

New York City Airbnb Data Exploration:

The data set used for this notebook describes the Airbnb listing activity in NYC, NY for 2019. 
The goal of this notebook is to gain a basic understanding about the distributions across the listing features and to extract simple metrics about the data set as a whole.

Breast Cancer Classification:

The goal of this notebook is to train a variety of classification models to classify malignant and benign breast cancer observations. Compare the predictive performance between the models and select a model that best classifies the data set
